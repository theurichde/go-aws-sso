# go-aws-sso

Make working with AWS SSO on local machines an ease.

## What is it about?

* Choose and retrieve short-living role credentials from all of your SSO available accounts and roles
* No nasty manual copy and pasting of credentials

### But... why? ü§î

* You have one go-to binary
* No external dependencies (e.g. a python runtime)
* Forget about dealing with different profiles and role names, just choose them directly!

## Features

* Choose your desired account and role interactively
* Choose your account and role via flags from command line
* Utilize AWSs `credential_process` to avoid storing credentials locally
* Refresh credentials based on your previously chosen account and role (if you've chosen to persist your credentials)
* Store your Start-URL and region

## Getting Started

### Installation

- via homebrew
    - `brew tap theurichde/go-aws-sso && brew install go-aws-sso`
- Download your according target platform binary from
  the [releases page](https://github.com/theurichde/go-aws-sso/releases)
- Compile from source with `go build -v ./cmd/go-aws-sso`
- use `go install github.com/theurichde/go-aws-sso/cmd/go-aws-sso@main`
    * Maybe you want to make sure your GOBIN is in your PATH üòâ

### Usage

#### Interactively Assume a Role

* Just execute `go-aws-sso`
    * When you run `go-aws-sso` the first time, you will be prompted for your SSO Start URL and your region
    * A config file (located at  `$HOME/$CONFIG_DIR/go-aws-sso/config.yml`) will be written with your values
* ‚ùî Verify your client request if necessary
* ‚úÖ Choose the account you want the roles to be displayed
* ‚úÖ Choose a role
    * in case there is only one role available this role is taken as default
* ü•≥ Tadaa ü•≥
    * `credentials_process` is written to `~/.aws/credentials` and fetches fresh credentials every time something calls
      AWS (implementing a proper creds caching mechanism is up to the calling program)
    * if you've added the flag `--persist`: short living credentials are written to `~/.aws/credentials`
